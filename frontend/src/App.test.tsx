// The account-capacity read is the one under test here because it is the
// cheapest of the four documented traps to provoke: it is the slowest read on
// the page (171 locations on a real account), the account can be changed while
// it is in flight, and without the `live` guard the slower answer wins -- so
// the numbers on screen are the previous account's, under the name of the one
// now selected. Nothing about that is visible in a type or in a review; it
// needs two answers outstanding at once, which is what `deferred` is for.
//
// Driven through the real controls rather than by poking state: switching
// account is the menu at the foot of the drawer, and a test that reached
// setAccountId directly would keep passing if that control stopped calling it.
