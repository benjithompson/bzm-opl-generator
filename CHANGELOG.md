# Changelog

All notable changes to bzm-opl-gen are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Group each release's notes under **Added**, **Changed**, **Fixed**, **Removed**
or **Security**, and drop any section that would be empty. Write entries for
the person upgrading: what changed for them, not which files moved. Lead with
anything that breaks.

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- **`sv-bridge` support.** The funcId is retired upstream, so it no longer
  selects an image, no longer appears in the create-location form, and no longer
  makes the service-virtualization ingress options mandatory. Locations that
  still carry the funcId now generate as ordinary performance locations — if you
  mirror images for one, the `sv-bridge` image is no longer in the set.

### Added

- **Web UI: the deployed virtual services, beside the heartbeat** — while
  watching an SV deployment, each one is listed with the endpoint host it
  publishes, refreshed on the existing poll. The agent reports idle whether or
  not its virtual services ever became reachable, so a deploy stalled at
  `WAITING_FOR_DOMAIN` used to look identical to a healthy one. Needs a
  kubecontext like `sv-expose` does; without one the panel still watches the
  heartbeat and says why the list is absent.
- **Web UI: configure one feature at a time.** The configure step shows the
  selected feature's options plus the ones that apply to any deployment. It is a
  view, not a scope — the manifests still come from the location's own funcIds,
  so nothing set under another feature is lost or omitted. Options set out of
  view are listed beside the preview; required ones missing from view block the
  download with a link to the feature that needs them. The feature list is
  served, so functional testing, secrets or API monitoring become selectable
  without a UI release.
- **Web UI: picking and creating are separate.** Starting to create a location
  or an agent hides the list of existing ones until you finish or cancel, so it
  is never ambiguous which of the two you are doing — they have very different
  consequences when an agent identity is already running somewhere.
- **Web UI: check whether a published endpoint answers.** Beside the virtual
  services in the watch panel, a check reports the HTTP status or which kind of
  failure it was. A 503 is the diagnosis rather than a broken check: it is the
  cluster refusing crane's port reference, and it names `sv-expose` as the fix.
- **Web UI: the SV prerequisites the bundle does not create** — wildcard TLS
  secret, Istio Gateway, the controller — now say who provides each one and what
  the chosen backend actually does with it, alongside the endpoint host to check
  after applying. Previously README-only, while the failure it prevents is
  silent: manifests apply, agent goes idle, mock runs 1/1, every deploy hangs at
  `WAITING_FOR_DOMAIN`.
- **Web UI: every funcId a location can be created with** is served from the
  generator rather than copied into the frontend, so `proxyRecorder` can be
  selected at last — the hardcoded list omitted it.
- **`ui --host`** — bind the web UI to something other than loopback, for when
  the machine running it is not the machine you are sitting at. The default is
  unchanged (`127.0.0.1`) and a widened bind warns at startup: the server holds
  your API key in process memory, and downloading a bundle rotates the
  AUTH_TOKEN out from under any agent already running for that ship. An SSH
  tunnel to the default bind does the same job without exposing the listener.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-26

First packaged release.

### Added

- **`generate`** — renders private-location manifests for Kubernetes and
  OpenShift from a location's real account facts, so the features it actually
  has decide which images ship and what `IMAGE_OVERRIDES` a private registry
  needs. Scenario presets cover the standard, private-registry and proxy/CA
  postures.
- **`facts`** — reads a location's enabled features, agents and live image
  inventory straight from the account, instead of you transcribing them.
- **`doctor`** — preflights a target cluster before anyone waits on a stuck
  run: capacity, quota, LimitRange, admission (PSA/SCC), ingress class and
  egress. Exits non-zero on anything that would stop a test from starting.
- **`toolcheck`** — preflights your own machine against the live rig's
  requirements, so a missing tool fails in seconds rather than 15 minutes in.
- **`livetest`** — deploys the generated manifests and waits for the agent to
  report online. Optional rigs reproduce the awkward customer environments
  locally: air-gapped registry, proxy with a custom CA, default-deny egress,
  and a real engine run.
- **`images`** — lists, pulls and mirrors a location's images to a private
  registry.
- **Web UI** (`bzm-opl-gen ui`) — connect, pick or create a location,
  configure, preview the manifests live and download them as a zip. Ships
  prebuilt in the wheel; no Node toolchain needed.
- **Service virtualization** — ingress configuration for istio, contour, nginx
  and OpenShift routes, plus `sv-expose` for reaching a virtual service where
  crane's own nginx Ingress doesn't resolve.
